= lir - Learning Information Retrieval

== VERSION

This documentation refers to lir version 0.3


== DESCRIPTION

LIR - Learning Information Retrieval ("Lehr- und Lernsystem Information Retrieval")
is an experimental information retrieval environment to teach and learn information
retrieval concepts. It is designed to be highly configurable and parametrisable.

The original aim (and still current use-case) was to support a practical course on
Automatic Indexing at the Institute of Information Science, Cologne University of
Applied Sciences, Germany. It should allow students to test their indexing results
and experiment with different algorithms for relevance ranking.

The main interface is through a pair of CGI scripts for indexing and querying. This
is completed by corresponding console scripts which provide a subset of the functionality.

First, you need to perform automatic indexing on your source documents (e.g., using
lingo[http://www.lex-lingo.de/]) and obtain frequency counts for the index terms.
Then you create index files for LIR with lir_index.pl (either CGI or console) and
you're ready to query your collection through lir.pl (again, either CGI or console).

=== Status

This project is more or less unmaintained and no longer actively developed. It's even
unfinished in parts, but should be functional on the whole (you can find a working
installation in the LINKS section below). YMMV, though.


== INSTALL

=== Requirements

LIR depends on some Perl modules and external programmes. The following list names
the Debian packages which need to be installed (including their dependencies):

* libapache2-mod-perl2
* libhtml-template-perl
* libdatetime-perl
* libmldbm-perl
* pdl
* perltidy
* sed

=== Web server configuration

Sample configuration for Apache (assuming that LIR has been installed in
<tt>/usr/local/lir</tt>):

  ScriptAlias /lir/cgi-bin/ "/usr/local/lir/cgi-bin/"
  <Directory "/usr/local/lir/cgi-bin">
    AllowOverride None
    Options None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
  </Directory>

  Alias /lir/ "/usr/local/lir/web/"
  <Directory "/usr/local/lir/web">
    Options Indexes MultiViews FollowSymLinks +Includes
    AllowOverride None
    Order allow,deny
    Allow from all
    AddType application/xhtml+xml .html .shtml
  </Directory>

  # restrict access to lir_index.pl
  <Files "lir_index.pl">
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "lir_index.pl"
    AuthUserFile /etc/apache2/passwd
    Require valid-user
  </Files>

The directories <tt>web/sources</tt> and <tt>data/lab</tt> have to be writable by
the web server process.

By default, an additional program parse_css.pl is used to allow variables in the
CSS files. It is available from github[http://github.com/blackwinter/scratch/tree/master/parse_css.pl]
and has to be installed as site-wide CGI script. Alternatively, you can replace
the dynamic CSS files with their static counterparts and/or adjust the paths in
the HTML and template files accordingly.
